        <div class="section" id="section2">
            <h2>2. Detailed System Architecture</h2>
            
            <p>The Trebound platform will be built on a modern, scalable, and resilient microservices architecture. This approach will enable us to develop and deploy new features independently, improve fault isolation, and scale individual services based on demand.</p>

            <h3>2.1. Architectural Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microservices:</strong> The platform will be composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a well-defined API.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud-Native:</strong> The entire infrastructure will be hosted on a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) to take advantage of their scalability, reliability, and managed services.</li>
                <li><strong>API-First:</strong> All platform functionality will be exposed through a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs, which will be used by the web and mobile frontends, as well as third-party integrations.</li>
                <li><strong>DevOps and Automation:</strong> We will adopt a DevOps culture and automate the entire software development lifecycle, from code commit to production deployment.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tech-stack">
                <h3>2.2. Technology Stack</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React with TypeScript for the web application, and React Native for the mobile app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> A combination of Node.js and Python for the microservices, depending on the specific requirements of each service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> A mix of SQL and NoSQL databases, including PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB for unstructured data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and a suite of managed services from the chosen cloud provider (e.g., AWS Lambda, S3, RDS).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>2.3. High-Level Architecture Diagram</h3>
            <div class="info">
                <p><em>A high-level architecture diagram will be created here, showing the major components of the system and their interactions.</em></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section3">
            <h2>3. User Hierarchy and Role-Based Access Control</h2>
            
            <p>The platform will support a flexible user hierarchy and role-based access control (RBAC) system to ensure that users only have access to the features and data that are relevant to their role.</p>

            <h3>3.1. User Roles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Employee:</strong> Can book travel, submit expense reports, and view their own travel history.</li>
                <li><strong>Manager:</strong> Can approve travel requests and expense reports for their direct reports, and view their team's travel spending.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrator:</strong> Can manage users, set travel policies, and access all platform features and data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2. Permissions</h3>
            <p>Permissions will be granular and can be customized for each role. For example, an administrator can grant a manager the ability to approve travel requests up to a certain amount, or restrict them to booking travel with preferred suppliers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section4">
            <h2>4. Database Design and Data Management</h2>
            
            <p>The platform will use a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases to store different types of data.</p>

            <h3>4.1. SQL Database (PostgreSQL)</h3>
            <p>The SQL database will be used to store structured, transactional data, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User profiles and credentials</li>
                <li>Travel policies and rules</li>
                <li>Bookings and reservations</li>
                <li>Expense reports and line items</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2. NoSQL Database (MongoDB)</h3>
            <p>The NoSQL database will be used to store unstructured or semi-structured data, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User preferences and search history</li>
                <li>Supplier content and pricing data</li>
                <li>Logs and analytics data</li>

            <h2>6. API Gateway and Service Communication</h2>
            
            <p>An API gateway will be used to provide a single entry point for all client requests and to handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, and logging.</p>

            <h3>6.1. API Gateway</h3>
            <p>The API gateway will be responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Request Routing:</strong> Routing incoming requests to the appropriate microservice.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Verifying the identity of the user and ensuring that they have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.</li>
                <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Protecting the backend services from being overwhelmed by too many requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Collecting logs and metrics for all incoming requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6.2. Service-to-Service Communication</h3>
            <p>Microservices will communicate with each other using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synchronous Communication:</strong> For requests that require an immediate response, services will communicate with each other using RESTful APIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Communication:</strong> For long-running or background tasks, services will communicate with each other using a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka).</li>
